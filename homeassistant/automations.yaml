# Home Assistant Automation for publishing chages to Weasley Clock state
# via MQTT. Includes the latitude and longitude of the user so that the
# Weasley clock can adjust the location of the hands based on how far the
# user is from home or maybe implement a seperate dial.
#
# Updates are sent when the user's state changes and when the
# weasleyclockd process connects to the Home Assistant MQTT server.
# When weasleyclockd connects it sends an "UPDATE" message. This also
# triggers an update.
